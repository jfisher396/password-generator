### About

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

### User Story

    AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
    THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
